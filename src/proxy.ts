 * Refreshes the Supabase session cookies on page requests. Never redirects (Guests may read).
 *
 * Every invocation of this function counts against the Vercel Hobby quotas (it is a Node function), so the
 * `matcher` below keeps it away from everything that does not need a session refresh:
 *  - requests without a session cookie (Guests): there is nothing to refresh;
 *  - link prefetches: they carry no new information about the session, and the real navigation that follows
 *    refreshes it. Without the proxy, a prefetch of a static shell is served by the CDN with no function at all;
 *  - static files and metadata files.
 * The prefetch check in the body stays as a safety net for requests the header filter would miss.
