/**
 * Name of the Supabase session cookie. Fixed (instead of the default `sb-<project ref>-auth-token`) so that
 * `src/proxy.ts` can run only for requests that carry a session: a Next.js matcher accepts literals only, and
 * the project ref differs between local and production. Every Supabase client must use it, or the session
 * written by one would not be read by the others.
 *
 * Long sessions are split in chunks named `<name>.0`, `<name>.1`, … (no `<name>` cookie then): the matcher
 * lists both forms. `src/proxy.test.ts` checks that the literals of the matcher match this constant.
